# NetDRMS local site configuration info.
#
# This file contains configurable parameters that allow NetDRMS sites to customize their DRMS installation. By editing this file, you can specify which resources to use, such as the PostgreSQL database host, you can specify arguments to certain programs, like arguments that control how often SUMS purges expired Storage Units, and you can enable/disable certain features, like remoteSUMS. Each line that is not a comment contains two columns of information. The first column contains the name of a parameter and the second contains its value. To customize your installation, you would edit the value in the second column.
#
# Once you have edited this file, you must run the configure script, which parses this file to create macros and constants and such that are used by the various DRMS components. These data are stored in files which are then either compiled into binaries or loaded by scripts. The configure script accomplishes much of this work by calling localize.py. The resulting files are stored in the localization directory. 

# The name of the NetDRMS database (e.g., sdac_drms, nso_drms); this is also the prefix of the SUMS database, 
#   which is constructed by appending "_sums" to the prefix.
DRMS_DATABASE	mydb

# The database user account that cgi programs access when they need to read from or write to database relations.
WEB_DBUSER      apache

# The host machine of the database server you will be accessing; if
#   the DRMS server and client reside on different subnets, then the host
#   name should be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). 
# A value of 'localhost' can be used, but it is only appropriate if you
#   are running in a single-user environment, such as on a laptop. In
#   this case, the client and the server are the same machine, so
#   it is not necessary to specify a host name for the server.
DBSERVER_HOST	localhost

# The port number for the DRMS database server - the default of 5432 is a
#   good choice, unless it is already in use.
DRMS_DBPORT	5432

# A 15-bit numerical site identifier. Values < 16384 (0x4000) are for
#   NetDRMS sites that create Storage Units for public export / distribution.
#   They must be unique across all DRMS sites. Values >= 16384 are for private
#   use and need not be unique across sites.
DRMS_SITE_CODE	0x4000

# The database user name of the postgres administrative account; this is normally "postgres"
#   if you have followed the PostgreSQL installation suggestions.
POSTGRES_ADMIN	postgres

# The following entries are specific to the SUMS configuration

# The user name of the SUMS administrator database account.
SUMS_MANAGER	production

# The linux group name for users permitted to add data to SUMS Storage Units; not
#   currently used in code, but should match the group ownership of
#   the SUMS root directories /SUM*
SUMS_GROUP	drms

# The host of the default SUMS server you will be using; this is the
#   the machine that the SUMS storage units are mounted on, not necessarily
#   the machine serving the PostgreSQL SUMS database.
SUMS_SERVER_HOST	localhost

# The machine hosting the SUMS database.
SUMS_DB_HOST            localhost

# The port number for the DRMS database server - the default of 5434 should be okay
#   unless it is in use already.
SUMS_DBPORT	5434

# The number of sum_svc processes, per sum service (e.g., SUM_get, SUM_alloc) to start, 
# by default, when multi-SUMS starts up.
SUM_NUMSUM    1

# The maximum number of sum_svc processes, per sums service.
SUM_MAXNUMSUM 8

# The base directory for SUMS logs and configuration files; used by
# sum_svc and sum_rm.
SUMS_LOG_BASEDIR	/usr/local/logs/SUM

# The directory in which sum_chmown, a root setuid program,
#   is installed; must be mounted locally on the machine on which the
#   SUMS partition are mounted; used by base/sums/apps/sum_svc_proc.c
SUMS_BIN_BASEDIR	/usr/local/bin

# If set to 1, then SUMS includes a tape-archive system.
SUMS_TAPE_AVAILABLE	0

# If set to 1, then SUMS has more than one partition set.
SUMS_MULTIPLE_PARTNSETS      0

# If AUTOSELCOMP is 1, then the configure script will automatically select
# the 'best' compiler for use with the make system (choosing icc over gcc).
# Set this to 0 to permit manual selection via the JSOC_COMPILER and JSOC_FCOMPILER
# environment variables, or via editing of make_basic.mk

# TABLE OF PRODUCTION USERS
#   These parameters are used by lib DRMS to identify a database table (not a data series)
#   that lists the database users that are 'production users'. These users have privileges
#   that ordinary users do not. For example, production users can reduce the retention of
#   data series that the production user does not own.

# Parameters for sum_rm

# This is the percentage at which all disk partitions are to be kept free.
# If not specified, this defaults to 3. For example, setting PART_PERCENT_FREE = 5 will allow all partitions to
# fill to 95% full. Dividing the number of unused blocks by the total number of blocks, and rounding up,
# will result in the number specified by PART_PERCENT_FREE.

# window, sum_rm will not scan for SUs to delete, not will it delete any SUs. Each value is an integer, 0-23, that

# local time, sum_rm will be dormant. To disable this behavior, set both parameters to the same value.

# NetDRMS users can request subdirectories from the Stanford proj directories 
# (e.g., JSOC/proj/util). These users will need to contact Stanford and obtain
# the source subdirectories desired. They will then place these subdirectories
# in the JSOC/proj directory of their NetDRMS release. To properly build 
# targets in these subdirectories, using the JSOC make system, the user needs
# to add entries to this configuration file - one entry for each subdirectory
# that contains source code to be compiled. Each entry is a space-separated pair
# of strings: the string "PROJDIR" followed by a subdirectory (of the proj 
# directory).  For example:
#
# PROJDIR     util/apps
# PROJDIR     util/libs
# 
# NOTE: It is not sufficient to list only a parent directory, like util. Source code
# in child directories will not automatically be compiled.
