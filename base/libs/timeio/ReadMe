The files in this directory are imported from the Stanford SOI pipeline
software library. They are considered "third party" because the configuration
management of the relevant files is not under CVS; they are imported directly
from the configuration managed SOI software tree. It is expected that the
code manager will maintain links of the appropriate files into their CM
area, and never perform a "cvs update" of those files, only a "cvs commit"
whenever the SOI CM versions have been modified. Conversely, others should
never do a "cvs commit" of any private modifications.
