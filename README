This is the top-level directory in the SDO/JSOC software tree.

The JSOC software tree compiles on the following architecture:

    * linux_ia32: X86 32-bit Intel and AMD processors: 
      e.g., n00, n01, ..., n11
    * linux_x86_64: X86 64-bit AMD and Intel processors
      e.g., n12, n13, n14, n15

Note: We no longer support linux_ia64 (Intel Itanium under SGI Irix)
after Ver_3-5-PreRelease.

A new make system is in place after Ver_3-5-PreRelease. If you have a
cvs working directory of or before Ver_3-5-PreRelease, you'll need to
run 'make clean' before 'cvs update' in order to clean up the .c files
generated from .pgc files in src/base/libsum_pg.

./configure only makes symbolic links for all header files in the JSOC
tree.  The binaries, as well as .c files generated from .pgc files,
are placed into architecture specific target directory, e.g.,
_linux_ia32. Symbolic links to executables and libraries are also made
in bin/ and lib/.

The default compiler is icc with optimization and without debug. Two
exceptions to this rule are src/base/libsum_pg and src/base/sum, both
of which are fixed to compile with 'gcc -g -O0'.

src/base/sum is not part of the default targets. Uncomment the
following line in src/base/sum/Rules.mk to change it.
#TGT_BIN		:= $(TGT_BIN) $(TGT_$(d))

Except for src/third_party/su, nothing in src/third_party is among the
default targets. 

To change your default compiler to gcc, modify the following line in
make_basic.mk from

COMPILER = icc

to 

COMPILER = gcc

Before changing this make variable, you should run 'make clean'.
A mixture of icc-compiled and gcc-compiled object files will
probably not link and/or run properly.

To enable debug, modify the following line in make_basic.mk from 

DEBUG =

to 

DEBUG = 1

Since there is only one Makefile for the whole JSOC tree, you must
always compile in this top level directory. However, you will be able
to make specific target, e.g., make drms_server.
