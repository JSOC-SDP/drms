	dcs3.jsoc:/home/production/cvs/JSOC/doc/dcs3_name_change.txt 10/15/2008


The system is configured for a 'hostname -s' of dcs3.
The full host name is dcs3.jsoc.Stanford.EDU

If the machine is renamed, everything will still work if 
the short hostnmae (hostname -s) is dcs3.

If the short hostname must be different than dcs3 then make
these changes:

--------------------------START CHANGES--------------------------------------

/etc/sudoers  change dcs3 to the new name (use visudo as root)

TO TEST:

> sum_start_dc
> cd /home/production/cvs/JSOC/proj/datacapture/scripts

Make sure your DISPLAY is set.
Normally you would just run:
> socdc

and just hit "Start Instances for HMI" or "Start Instances for AIA"
accordingly.

If you want to run in sim mode where data is generated as if coming
from the DDS, then either run socdc0 or socdc1 for AIA or HMI simulation
respectively.
