	dcs3:/home/production/cvs/JSOC/doc/dcs3_name_change.txt 10/15/2008


The system is configured for a 'hostname -s' of dcs3.
The full host name is dcs3.jsoc.Stanford.EDU

If the machine is renamed, everything will still work if 
the short hostnmae (hostname -s) is dcs3.

If the short hostname must be different than dcs3 then make
these changes:

--------------------------START CHANGES--------------------------------------

Make sure your DISPLAY is set.
Normally you would just run:

accordingly.

If you want to run in sim mode, select simulate radio button before
select 'Start Instances'.
