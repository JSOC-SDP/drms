        Convert dcs2 to dcs0 or dcs1
        -----------------------------

Here are the steps to enable network connection to DDS from the
dcs spare (dcs2).

1. If the system to be replaced is still alive, login and
   run "ifdown eth3" as root.

2. Log in the spare (dcs2) as root and run the command
   "/etc/sysconfig/network/XXX-up" where XXX is either
   AIA or HMI depending on which dcs system it is about
   to replace.

3. Open the front door of the NASA rack, unplug the red
   ethernet cable labelled "dcsx XXX ..." where x is 0 
   for XXX==AIA or 1 for XXX==HMI, and plug the loose 
   ethernet cable labelled "dcs spare" into the same port 
   vacated by the cable you've just unplugged.
 
4. To restore the original dcs2 to itself do:

   /etc/sysconfig/network/XXX-up/MYSELF-up

   And don't forget to move the cable back to the dcs0 or dcs1.
