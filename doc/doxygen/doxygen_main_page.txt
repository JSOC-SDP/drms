/** \mainpage JSOC Reference

This is the developer and design manual for JSOC. Previous
documentation has been integrated into this and it should always be up
to date since it is generated directly from the source files using
Doxygen.

\section general General design documents

Start with the "ManPage Sections" tab for html versions of the JSOC software manual
pages.

\section hacking Hacking on this documentation

There is the beginning of a style guide for documenting under
\ref tipshints.

There is an example module documentation man page at
\ref module_template.

Feel free to start documenting or playing with doxygen configuration.
This main page can be found in doc/doxygen_main_page.txt .

This main page is just an introduction to doxygen markup, see the
Doxygen manual for the full command set.

\section tips An introduction to doxygen markup

\subsection Locations What to document

All declarations for:

-# typedef
-# struct
-# enum
-# functions

This will enable doxygen to link all parameter types to the declarations
every time the type is used in a function - very helpful to new developers.

\subsection Files Private files

If your declarations are in separate files, like private header files,
a simple block can still be linked into doxygen as long as the file is
identified to doxygen using a '\\file' section:

 \\file filename.h\n
 \\brief one-liner summary of the file purpose\n
 \\author the usual copyright statement

\subsection Methods How to document

Every doxygen comment block starts with an adapted comment marker. 
You can use an extra slash /// or an extra asterisk. Blocks end
in the usual way. Doxygen accepts commands using a backslash.

To put a description with each function or structure, use '\\brief'
End the brief description with a blank line. The rest of the documentation will
then be shown in the body of the doxygen page.

Commands may begin with \\ or @

\subsection Presentation Extras

	-# Start a line with a hyphen to start a list - the indent determines the
nesting of the list:
		- To create a numbered list, use -# e.g. for a sublist:
			-# start a numbered list
		- revert to previous list

	End the list with a blank line.
Use :: at the start of a function or structure to link to the page
for that function in the doxygen documentation. e.g.  ::qof_class_foreach

Use the param command to describe function parameters in the text.

Use the 'back reference' to document enumerator values:\n
enum testenum {\n
	enum_one **&lt; less than marker tells doxygen to use this line
		to document enum_one.

\subsection config Editing Doxygen configuration

To edit the doxygen configuration, you can use:
*
cd doc
*
vi doxygen_publ.cfg &

/*! \page reference Doxygen reference documentation

The Doxygen web site (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) has a
complete user manual.  For the impatient, here are the most
interesting sections:

- How to write grouped documentation for files, functions, variables,
etc.: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/grouping.html .  Do not
forget to add a file documentation block (\@file) at the top of your
file. Otherwise, none of the documentation in that file will appear
in the html output.
