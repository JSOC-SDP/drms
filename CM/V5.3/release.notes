                       Release Notes JSOC V5.3         5Aug2009
                       -----------------------         ---------


A release is a set of files, each having a specific version.  And a release typcially
has a version number because over time you have newer and newer releases of the 
same product.  For example, a hypothetical 1.3 release may contain fileA#1.8, 
fileB#1.2, fileC#2.2 and a 1.4 release may contain fileA#2.5, fileB#2.1, fileC#2.9. 
JSOC releases are similarly versioned and contain a set of such files.  JSOC release
code is guaranteed to compile on cluster nodes (eg., n00, n02).  The resulting binaries
have been minimally tested.  At the time of the creation of the release, the
release versions of each file will be the most recent.  But as time passes, newer versions 
of some files will be made, and there is no guarantee that these changes will
not destabilize JSOC (ie., they may cause JSOC to no longer compile or execute
properly).  

There are several ways to use this release.  If you wish to simply use pre-built
binaries, you can simply use the production binaries, which are located at 
/home/production/cvs/JSOC.  Every time a release is created, the binaries in
this location get updated.  Only the production user can update these binaries.
So, you could run /home/production/cvs/JSOC/bin/linux_x86_64/show_keys, for example.
If instead you want to work with stable source files, then you must have a sandbox,
which is a local copy (in your home directory) of the files in the cvs depot.  
You would probably want to work with a sandbox if you plan on making eventual 
changes to the depot files.  Changes you make to your sandbox files are not visible 
to other users until you "commit" those changes back to the cvs depot.  Please see
"If You Don't Have a Sandbox" below for more information on how to create a sandbox.  
There is also a "working" release which resides in in /home/jsoc/cvs/JSOC.  New 
files may be placed here and existing files may be edited for common use before the 
next official release.  Each time a release gets created, the source and binaries of 
the working release get updated.  WARNING: the files you see here may not be stable 
since by the time you see them, another user may have edited them. Only the production 
release is guaranteed to be stable and unchanged between releases.

Obtaining the Release
---------------------
To update your working directory to this release, or to check-out this release anew, 
please visit http://jsoc.stanford.edu/jsocwiki/CvsInit. Please keep in mind that
users may have modified files since the release was created, so use of the 
scripts documented in the web page may result in a working directory whose
content is not identical to the release.  If updating, you can supply 
the flag "-R" to the jsoc_update.pl and jsoc_sync.pl scripts to download the
latest release.  This will ensure that your working directory has the exact, latest
release versions of the files (eg., jsoc_sync.csh -R). If checking-out, 
you can supply the argument "-r Ver_LATEST" to the "cvs checkout" command
to achieve the analogous result, but for a fresh checkout.  WARNING: if you use 
the "-R" or "-r" flags, please use only jsoc_update.pl or jsoc_sync.pl to update 
your sources thereafter.  Use of "-R" or "-r Ver_LATEST" will result in a cvs
"sticky flag" being set.  jsoc_update.pl and jsoc_sync.pl clear this sticky flag.

Additional Info
---------------
If you are unfamiliar with the use of cvs see the file:
JSOC/CM/working_with_sandbox.txt.

There's a linux4 cvs gui at xim:/usr/bin/lincvs
Also on our jsoc web page:

http://jsoc.stanford.edu/cvs/JSOC/

Use the Apache cvs gui to see the diffs. For example, go to
http://jsoc.stanford.edu/cvs/JSOC/base/drms/
and click on the name in the File column and then click on
"diffs to previous #" to see the diffs.

Changes since previous release (V5.3 - Aug 4, 2009)
--------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES:
* Revert code that reserved the DRMS DATE keyword so that it couldnt' be exported as the corresponding FITS keyword. Instead, users who want to export FITS files with DATE keywords need to create a DRMS DATE keyword in their jsd. This will make a DRMS DATE keyword that gets exported to a FITS DATE keyword.
* Fix a problem show_info -j: it was generating an extra '0' in the data specification for generic segments.
* Fix problem where timeio wasn't handling invalid time strings properly.
* cmdparams had the wrong internal time value that represents JD_0.
* Fix the drms_ismissing_time function - wasn't comparing properly.
