			SUM Version 2.1 Release Notes:		24May2006

The V2.1 particulars are:

  *the sum_svc runs on d00 as user production. If you need to start it do:
   sum_svc jsoc &

  *the SUMS now runs under Postgres. There is no longer an Oracle server 
running on hmidb.

  *the t120 tape robot is supported. It is fully populated with 120 
tapes and the import/export of tapes to the shelf via the EE door is 
supported. All status dislay and operator interaction with the t120 is via
the t120view program (soon to be tui - t120 user interface).

  *tape archiving is implemented. the tapearc program will write all
archive pending storage units to tape. The group id of a storage unit is 
assigned by DRMS, and is dynamically assigned to an available tape by SUMS.
We need to discuss the assingning of group ids to DRMS data series.

  *Each group id has a retention time of its tapes in the robot. This is defined
in the sum_group table. Values for the different groups has not yet been
defined.

  *Each file written to tape will have an md5cksum calculated and stored in
the sum_file table. This is for off-site verification purposes and ad hoc
integrity checks.

  *a disk scrubber runs every 20 mins (configured by
/home/jim/cvs/jsoc/tables/sum_rm.cfg.hmidb) and will delete expired delete
pending storage units.

  *The effective date for a SUM data segment to be deleted, or a tape eligible
for unload will now be to the hh_mm instead of just the day.

  *SUM db backup on hmidb is TBD as a Postgres cron job.

  *All V2.1 SUM storage units created are now considered "real"
and will be propagated forward to future releases.

  *Must be compiled with gcc. icc gives seg fault when this is false:
        if(p == q_rd_front)
