			SUM Version 2.0 Release Notes:		02Feb2006

The V2.0 particulars are:

  *the sum_svc runs on d00 as user production. If you need to start it do:
   sum_svc hmidb &

  *the t120 tape robot is now supported. It is fully populated with 120 
tapes and the import/export of tapes to the shelf via the EE door is 
supported. All status dislay and operator interaction with the t120 is via
the t120view program (soon to be tui - t120 user interface).

  *tape archiving is implemented. the tapearc program will write all
archive pending storage units to tape. The group id of a storage unit is 
assigned by DRMS, and is dynamically assigned to an available tape by SUMS.

  *a disk scrubber runs every 20 mins (configured by
/home/jim/cvs/jsoc/tables/sum_rm.cfg.hmidb) and will delete expired delete
pending storage units. The resolution on the expiration time is still a day.
This will be changed in a later release.

  *SUM db backup on hmidb is performed nightly by an ora10 cron job.

  *All V2.0 SUM storage units created are considered transient 
   and will not necessarily be propagated forward to future releases.

  *Must be compiled with gcc. icc gives seg fault when this is false:
        if(p == q_rd_front)
